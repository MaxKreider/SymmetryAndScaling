This repository contains codes used to produce the figures in the manuscript "A model free method for discovering symmetry in differential equations" by Max Kreider, John Harlim, and Daning Huang.

To produce Figure X in section 5 of the manuscript, simply download and run Fig_X.m.
Please note that producing the convergence plots may take several minutes.

Some scripts may require additional MATLAB toolboxes (parallel computing, etc.).
